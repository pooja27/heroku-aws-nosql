	Login:  Username as email /password
	Signup:	email /password /confirm password /age ? /gender ?
	Billing history: invoice generated for every transaction maintained here.
	Product Catalog: Include - tea? coffe? equipment as categories?

-Mongodb as database for product catalog. 
-Installed mongo and mongo client robo-mongo for handling and firing queries.
-Studied mongodb with respect to architecture and query model.
-Reading the partition tolerance for MongoDB.

-For the second database, we will be using redis for maintaining user-sessions.
-Since we have decided store billing history, there can be analytics that can be done with Cassandra.

-In the next week I am planning to check the partition tolerance for Mongodb on AWS.
-Read cassandra to explore its analytic features and check for its feasibility.
