Week4:
1. To setup mongod replica set, I tried using AWS template for an already created VPC.
2. AWS couldnot complete the setup and the operation was rolled back. Tried this setup twice.
3. Tried the second template provided by AWS with permissions for AWS to create its own VPC, that did not work too.
4. Started to setup manually the replica set. Created a 3 node cluster and assigned public IPs. Configured them to listen on port 27017.
5. Could not deploy the replica set, was facing issues with initial set up.
6. 2. Inititally I was trying setting up a new micro instance and configure but that was taking longer and was a tedious task.
7. I created an AMI with mongod installed on it, that saved a lot of time later.
8. Later in the week, with changes in hostnames and config file for mongo, the setup was complete.
9. Successfully deployed the replica set on AWS dataset.
10. Migrated all the datasets from the local database onto the AWS datasets.
11. Tested the queries for all CRUD operations and replication for the replica set.
12. Testing partition tolerance with multiple scenarios, election not working fine.
13. Had to set up an arbiter instance to resolve conflicts and help in election.
14. Initial tests with send requests to primary/secondary for writing and reading work fine.
14. Planning on spawning multiple secondary nodes to test thoroughly.
