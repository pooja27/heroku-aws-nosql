- This week , I completed development of the login and sign-up homepage for the Starbucks project. 
- The technologies used for Login development is : BootStrap,Angular JS,HTML5 and CSS3. 
- Apart from Login option, I have also commited the code for the sing up page.
- I learnt using Angular JS for building rich one page login application and used it in our sign-up module.
- The sign-up is also built over a bootstrap modal box that serves as a rich UI. On clicking the modal box, the user sees the registration web page.
- After the login page was developed, I proceeded with the homescreen page after the team accepted it.
- I have finished developing some portion of the homescreen and the remaining shall be done in the coming week.
- The team also spent time together to decide on the REST endpoints to be implemented. 
- I have parallely taken up the task to learn deployment on Heroku which shall be completed and implemented in the coming week.
- In the coming week, my main area of focus would be intergration of code with databases and deployment on Heroku.
