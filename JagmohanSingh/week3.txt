The issues are being taken care of sometime, got issues while working alongside of AWS and Heroku on REST Calls.Some changes are done, as the Idea of second database for storing session is dropped off after having discussion with professor due to overcome the hectic process of working on two databases.Also some changes are done on development strategy a first the application being developed with mongodb connector, but now the rest Apis are being used to communicate between AWS server and Heroku server. Somewhere seems stuck on catalogue page. I have reopened that, as the it is not behaving properly. Not all the products available are in sync. The product module is giving some issue, working on that. Database team is informed to check whether there is any issue on that side.
